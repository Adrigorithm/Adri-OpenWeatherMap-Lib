OpenWeatherMap API Library for Flutter (dart).
I made this because I couldn't find any good ones out there that cover more than 2 basic api get requests.

I will try to implement as many components as possible and update it when it appears necessary.

## Features

It sends get requests to hopefully get a 200 response with your requested data. 

What's that, were you fishing for more? Well sorry to disappoint but this is what the lib does lmao.

You want stuff faster:

## Getting started

TODO: Install this like any other package.

## Usage

First of, for the love of god use IntelliSense (the thing that (among other things) makes code suggestions).

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder. 

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

Idk

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to 
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect 
from the package authors, and more.
